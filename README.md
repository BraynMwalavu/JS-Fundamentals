# JS-Fundamentals

This repository contains foundational JavaScript scripts developed as part of the **ALX Frontend Engineering program**. Each file corresponds to a specific task aimed at strengthening core JavaScript concepts such as variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and argument handling.

The scripts are written for execution in a Node.js environment and follow best practices such as using `const`/`let` instead of `var`, leveraging built-in functions, and maintaining clean, readable code.
